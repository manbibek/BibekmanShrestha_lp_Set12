First things first. You cannot start building a website/app without assessing how the client envisions the final output. 
Therefore I'd start with interviewing the client. The salient points of focus would be his target audience, 
the scope/functionalities of the website/app and of course, budget range. There could basically be several ways to go 
for a custom printed t-shirt website:
	It may just contain the portfolio of the company along with contact address.
	It may be an ecommerce site allowing customers to buy pre-designed/printed t-shirts.
	It may have provisions for customers to actually design the t-shirt within the website using a dynamic modelling tool.
	The customers may just upload their design request.
	and so on.

Based on the rough vision of the client, I would then start preparations by building a rough sitemap and 
selecting which web technologies, frameworks to use for CMS, Shopping Cart, Style Sheets, etc.

The most important factors in deciding the mode of development would be the complexity of the project and the size of the 
development team. Assuming a medium to low complexity and small team size, I'd probably opt for Agile development model.
