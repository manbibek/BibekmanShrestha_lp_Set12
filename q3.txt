The basic difference between QA and QC is that QA ensures quality in process while QC ensures quality in products.
It means that Quality Assurance basically works during the product developmental process while Quality Control works after the product is completed.

Quality Assurance is used to make sure that the process of development of product is as efficient and close to perfect as can be possible within the constraints.
This mostly includes strict management policies and strategies, proper planning, using new and efficient technologies, etc. Each and every member of the developmental
team is responsible for QA. For example, in a car manufacturing company,QA would be using state of the art manufacturing equipments, 
well managed supply-chain and resource planning, using new technologies, etc.

Quality Control on the other hand is used to make sure that the product has no defects through series of testing mechanisms. It makes sure that no faulty product
reaches the hand of the customer. A certain testing team oversees the Quality Control. For example, in a car manufacturing company, QC would be 
crash tests, testing for engine leaks, test drive, testing durability of suspension, etc.
